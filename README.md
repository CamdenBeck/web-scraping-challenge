# web-scraping-challenge

## Description 
In this project, data was scraped from two webpages: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html and https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html. The data was then analysed and documented.

## Data
The first webpage listed above returned a news webpage.

The second webpage listed above returned a table of weather conditions on mars throughout a given time.

The data scraped in this project was saved to [data/mars_data.csv](data/mars_data.csv).

## Notebooks
### Notebook 1: [part_1_mars_news.ipynb](part_1_mars_news.ipynb)
This is a Jupyter Notebook that executes python code to scrape titles and preview text from articles posted on the first webpage.

### Notebook 2: [part_2_mars_weather.ipynb](part_2_mars_weather.ipynb)
This is a Jupyter Notebook that executes python code to scrape data from a table posted on the second webpage. This data is then analysed and displayed in different types of charts (bar charts and line charts), showing some patterns in Mars' weather data.

The data that is scraped in this notebook is saved to [data/mars_data.csv](data/mars_data.csv).
